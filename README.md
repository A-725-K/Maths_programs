# Maths_programs

This repository contains different programs:
  + Inference: a simple exercise written in C to study with an example the confidence interval.
  + Linear_Eq_2_variables: a resolver for Diophantine equations in two variables writte in C++.
  + Numeric_Calculus: laboratories for the university course, it contains
    - Lab1: Relative and Absolute Error and Machine Epsilon (C++).
    - Lab2: Condition Number and Matrices (C++).
    - Lab3: Singular-Value Decomposition (Matlab).
    - Lab4: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors (Matlab).
  + OCaml:
    - sample_encoding.ml: does some simple encoding/encoding.
    - taylor.ml: computes the Taylor Polynomial centered in X_0.
  + Prolog:
    - simple_logic_exercises: contains some logic operator with sets and some Primitive Recursive Function on natural       
      numbers written in the form of 0 and s(...s(0)...).
  + Python:
    - 1/magic_square.py: realize, thanks to the Z3 library, a solver for a magic_square.
    - 2/system_of_equations.py: again with Z3 library, the solution a simple system of equations.
  + Machine_Learning
    - NearestNeighbor: simple implementation of Nearest Neighbor (NN) algorithm in GNU Octave
